However, those same settlers then used this newfound power to turn on the elves, driving them to the southern forests where they now reside; this incident is the basis for the hostility between humans and elves in Egea. In the year 952, magic was outlawed and all libraries of spellbooks burned in the human kingdoms after an order of mages attempted to overthrow the king of Normund, but Osirus the Great legalized magic again when he became emperor in 1274.<br /><br />+2 Resolve<br />-1 Wisdom"

Since then, others - namely nobles, since only the rich can afford to hire the sorcerers and purchase the materials needed - have followed suit, and owning an angel has become a sort of status symbol among the upper class of Tyraca, despite the Temple of Twelve frowning on the practice.<br /><br />Elves and demons dislike angels, as well, though for different reasons: the elves are horrified that such a sacred (and feared) ancient ritual has been appropriated and corrupted by humans, and the demons despise all things magic-related, especially things created with magic.<br /><br />+1 Vitality<br />+1 Wisdom<br />-1 Might"

        "Death is the rarest elemental affinity and the least researched. Those with an affinity for it are marked by the 'touch of death;' they suck the life out of any living thing they touch, plant or animal, including the one that gave birth to them. As such, they're regarded as bad omens in nearly every culture, and they have to remain covered at all times so they don't accidentally touch something (or someone) and kill it.<br /><br />Mages of death are few and far between, but those that exist can control the dead. They can bind the spirits of the deceased to objects of their choosing, generally corpses or skeletons. Benevolent death mages are sometimes employed by cemeteries and ossuaries to make sure the dead stay at peace.<br /><br />+1 Resolve"

The port attracts numerous traders and merchants, many of whom are interested in the plentiful resources of the forest and access to what little they can trade with the elves. Dimona's main export is lumber obtained from the northern edge of the Nalani Forest, further inciting the elves' hostility towards humans since to them the forest is a sacred, spiritual place, not a commodity."

Large golden pyramids once constructed to honor the royal dead now stand abandoned and crumbling, overtaken by plants and wildlife.

In times of peace, the Guardians are the enforcers of Nalani law; in times of war, they become the nation's main military force alongside their Lupios allies.

The Falls are also famous for the tree-sized bioluminescent mushrooms that can be found there, often providing shelter for weary travelers during rainstorms. While there are a few permanent settlements here and there, flooding is a constant threat, and so most of the druids who inhabit The Falls travel in wandering caravans, adhering strictly to a barter system to get what they need in order to support their group.<br /><br />While the druids do believe in the Goddess of Order and thus believe in the sanctity of the Holy Mother of Nalan as Her voice, their belief in the old ways of balance and harmony between order and chaos sets them apart from their western neighbors. As a result, they largely govern themselves, electing a council of elders to settle disputes between caravans but otherwise acting independently."

One theory is that it's the sirens' doing, since they are known to have powerful wind and water magic, and because sirens are, in fact, the only known race living on and around the archipelago of islands.<br /><br />The lack of information regarding the islands is due in large part to the foreboding swamps created when chunks of rock floated upwards and water from the ocean rushed in and filled the gaps, creating permanent pools of flooded terrain. A number of dangerous creatures lurk in the swamps, including sirens, which tend to scare potential explorers and scholars away."
